(High Priority) Given the documented allergy and adverse extrapyramidal reactions to haloperidol in April 2011, has haloperidol been permanently avoided in all care settings, and are alternative antipsychotics consistently used to manage Lewy Body Dementia-related psychosis and agitation?\n\nRationale: Avoidance of typical antipsychotics like haloperidol is critical due to risk of worsening parkinsonism and adverse effects in Lewy Body Dementia patients.\n\n2. (High Priority) Considering paroxysmal atrial fibrillation managed only with aspirin and the patient\u2019s advanced age and dementia, has a formal stroke risk assessment (e.g., CHA2DS2-VASc score) been performed, and should anticoagulation therapy be reconsidered in light of bleeding vs thromboembolic risk?\n\nRationale: Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation requires risk assessment; aspirin alone may be insufficient, especially with cognitive decline and fall risk.\n\n3. (High Priority) How is the patient\u2019s hydration status and renal function being monitored post-hospice initiation, particularly given the history of volume-sensitive fluctuations in CKD (stage III-IV) and prior acute kidney injury episodes?\n\nRationale: Preventing dehydration and renal decompensation can improve comfort and avoid hospitalizations in end-stage renal disease in hospice.\n\n4. (Medium Priority) Has the rationale for discontinuing vitamin B12 supplementation in May 2011 been clearly documented and confirmed to avoid potential deficiency, given the earlier documented B12 deficiency and its contribution to neurocognitive symptoms?\n\nRationale: Vitamin B12 deficiency can exacerbate cognitive decline and neuropathy; repletion status should be clear and monitored.\n\n5. (Medium Priority) Is there a current, detailed cognitive and functional baseline established for the patient, including formal dementia subtype diagnosis and severity staging, to guide symptom management and care planning?\n\nRationale: Limited documentation before 2011 on dementia subtype and baseline cognition may hamper tailored therapeutic decisions.\n\n6. (Medium Priority) Given the progressive failure to thrive and poor oral intake, are there established protocols for nutritional support, non-pharmacological interventions, and symptom palliation that align with hospice goals, and have family education and support been sufficiently addressed?\n\nRationale: Ensuring quality of life and comfort care requires proactive nutritional and psycho-social management consistent with goals of care.\n\n7. (Low Priority) Has the patient\u2019s blood pressure and hypertension management been periodically reviewed in the context of fluctuating renal function and medication changes, ensuring blood pressure targets avoid hypotension and preserve renal perfusion?\n\nRationale: Variable antihypertensive use with discontinued agents (e.g., HCTZ, metoprolol, lisinopril) necessitates ongoing individualized BP management.\n\n8. (Low Priority) What is the planned frequency and scope of neurology follow-up for dementia and parkinsonism, especially monitoring progression of extrapyramidal symptoms and adjusting antipsychotic dosing?\n\nRationale: Neurology input is essential for progressive neurodegenerative symptom management and medication side effect mitigation.\n\n9. (Low Priority) Are there any pending or planned diagnostic studies (e.g., neuroimaging, lab panels) or referrals that need completion to clarify unclear aspects of the patient\u2019s CKD staging or dementia subtype?\n\nRationale: Addressing documentation gaps in CKD staging and dementia diagnosis can refine prognosis and care plans.\n\n10. (Low Priority) Has the family\u2019s capacity to provide increasing home support and understand complex medication regimens been assessed regularly, with interpreter or language support provided, to optimize adherence and reduce hospitalization risk?\n\nRationale: Language barriers and caregiver burden can impact treatment compliance and patient safety."}, "87209a04-6251-51a2-9b48-ea1d71a570bf": {"summary": "1.

Chronic hypoxemia necessitated escalating oxygen therapy. He experienced infectious complications and ultimately died during an attempt to surgically manage perforated diverticulitis, with intraoperative cardiac arrest from severe RV failure. The medical course highlights the challenges of managing end-stage cardiopulmonary disease and the need for comprehensive multidisciplinary care including advanced care planning.", "questions": "CLINICAL QUESTIONS:\n\n1. (High Priority) Given the progressive and severe pulmonary hypertension with persistent RV failure despite sildenafil and inhaled treprostinil therapy (mPAP 51, PVR 12.1 at diagnosis, ongoing worsening), were additional advanced PAH therapies or referral for lung transplantation or palliative interventions considered during the disease course?\n\n_Rationale: This addresses whether maximal PH-specific treatment and advanced care planning were optimized to potentially improve survival or quality of life._\n\n2. (High Priority) After multiple right heart failure exacerbations treated with IV diuretics and inotropes, was there an attempt to reintroduce beta-blockers cautiously earlier than held in 2016, considering the borderline LV function and HFpEF?\n\n_Rationale: Beta-blocker withholding was noted due to RV failure, but reassessment could influence rhythm, ischemia, and LV function management._\n\n3. (High Priority) Did the patient undergo comprehensive infectious surveillance and vaccination protocols (e.g., pneumococcal, influenza) to mitigate recurrent infectious complications (UTI 2016, pneumonia 2017) that precipitated hospitalizations?\n\n_Rationale: Preventing infections could reduce acute decompensations in this vulnerable patient with chronic hypoxemia and heart failure._\n\n4. (Medium Priority) What was the rationale for not pursuing a lung biopsy to confirm and better characterize the suspected NSIP pattern of ILD, and could targeted anti-fibrotic or immunomodulatory treatment have impacted hypoxemia progression?\n\n_Rationale: Tissue diagnosis might have allowed tailored ILD therapy potentially slowing respiratory decline._\n\n5. (Medium Priority) Were oxygen delivery adjustments, titration protocols, and monitoring of oxygenation targets regularly reviewed and optimized in response to escalating home oxygen requirements and chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure?\n\n_Rationale: Optimizing oxygen therapy impacts symptom control and prevents hypoxia-related complications._\n\n6. (Medium Priority) Given documented non-compliance and intolerance to CPAP for obstructive sleep apnea, were alternative treatments or reassessments conducted to address sleep-disordered breathing contributing to hypoxia and cardiac strain?\n\n_Rationale: Untreated OSA exacerbates pulmonary hypertension and heart failure; alternative therapies may improve outcomes._\n\n7. (Low Priority) Was there documentation of involvement of multidisciplinary services such as pulmonary rehabilitation, nutrition, and palliative care before the final hospitalization, to address cachexia, functional decline, and advance care planning?\n\n_Rationale: Supportive care interventions could improve quality of life and symptom management in chronic, progressive disease._\n\n8. (Low Priority) Were renal function trends and electrolyte monitoring sufficiently frequent to guide diuretic dosing adjustments and prevent further renal impairment, given episodes of worsening creatinine (peak 2.2) and heavy diuretic use?\n\n_Rationale: Preserving renal function is critical in managing volume status safely._\n\n9. (Low Priority) How was adherence to the pulmonary hypertension medication regimen monitored and addressed, especially considering dosage increases and possible inconsistencies noted across admissions?\n\n_Rationale: Ensuring consistent PH drug adherence affects symptom control and disease progression._\n\n10. (Low Priority) Was there a plan for ongoing surveillance of coronary artery disease stability, including ischemic evaluation, given diffuse disease and discontinued beta-blocker use?\n\n_Rationale: CAD surveillance is important to prevent ischemic events that could further impair cardiac function._"}, "00066a3d-da97-5cff-91a1-574c436c037a": {"summary": "1.

(High Priority) Given the patient\u2019s recurrent catheter-related bloodstream infections from 2011-2013 and multiple line removals, what strategies can be implemented to optimize central line care, reduce infection risk, and is there a role for alternative vascular access methods or earlier line removal to prevent further septic episodes?\n\nRationale: Recurrent line infections were a major cause of morbidity and hospitalizations and contributed to septic shock and mortality.\n\n2. (High Priority) Considering the patient\u2019s progressive portopulmonary hypertension managed with escalating doses of treprostinil and sildenafil, how should pulmonary hemodynamics and right heart function be monitored serially to guide therapy adjustments and assess transplant candidacy or timing?\n\nRationale: Progressive pulmonary hypertension was a key contributor to clinical deterioration and transplant risk.\n\n3. (High Priority) Was the management and adjustment of diuretics (furosemide, spironolactone, torsemide) adequately balanced to control ascites and volume overload without precipitating renal dysfunction during the patient\u2019s multiple admissions?\n\nRationale: Volume status fluctuations contributed to hospitalizations, renal issues, and encephalopathy.\n\n4. (Medium Priority) How effectively were hepatic encephalopathy episodes managed with lactulose and rifaximin dosages, and were there any documented medication adherence or side effect issues that may have contributed to recurrent confusion?\n\nRationale: Encephalopathy was frequent but mostly reversible; optimization is critical to prevent deterioration.\n\n5. (Medium Priority) Given the chronic osteomyelitis and vertebral compression fractures with ongoing pain managed by opioids and gabapentin, what multidisciplinary strategies including pain specialist involvement could optimize pain control while minimizing narcotic side effects such as sedation and constipation?\n\nRationale: Chronic pain and narcotics impacted functional status and cognitive symptoms.\n\n6. (Medium Priority) Was there a standardized surveillance protocol followed for variceal bleeding risk (e.g., repeat EGD timing) and other portal hypertension complications, and were recommendations consistently adhered to between hospitalizations?\n\nRationale: Variceal bleeding and portal hypertension complications necessitate close monitoring to prevent acute events.\n\n7. (Medium Priority) Are laboratory trends (e.g., pancytopenia, neutropenia) sufficiently monitored for early detection of marrow suppression potentially related to antibiotics or liver disease, and is there a documented plan for management or specialist referral?\n\nRationale: Multiple episodes of neutropenia and pancytopenia complicated therapy and increased infection risks.\n\n8. (Low Priority) Considering documented nutritional challenges and use of Isosource tube feeds with megestrol acetate, were nutritional status and weight consistently monitored, and was enteral feeding optimized to improve immunity and wound healing?\n\nRationale: Malnutrition may exacerbate infection risk and poor wound healing.\n\n9. (Low Priority) Given the high frequency of admissions and complex multisystem disease, is there evidence of coordinated multidisciplinary care including hepatology, infectious disease, pulmonology, pain management, and psychiatry to ensure comprehensive outpatient follow-up and reduce hospitalizations?\n\nRationale: Enhanced care coordination may improve outcomes and outpatient stability.\n\n10.

(High Priority) Given episodes of mechanical gastric outlet obstruction and delayed gastric emptying documented by MRCP and gastric studies, what interventions or surgical consultations were considered to relieve obstruction and improve nutrition prior to progression to critical illness?  \n*Rationale:* Gastric outlet obstruction contributed to poor oral intake, dehydration, AKI, and recurrent hospitalizations.\n\n4. (High Priority) Was the patient evaluated and managed for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after transient hypoxia and tachycardia events in 2015, and could earlier OSA diagnosis have mitigated cardiopulmonary complications?  \n*Rationale:* Possible unaddressed OSA may have worsened respiratory status and cardiovascular strain.\n\n5. (Medium Priority) How frequently were renal function, proteinuria, and electrolyte abnormalities monitored during outpatient care, and what strategies were in place to prevent AKI episodes given the patient\u2019s susceptibility (creatinine spike to 3.4, progression to chronic renal failure)?  \n*Rationale:* Recurrent AKI episodes accelerated renal decline and systemic complications.\n\n6. (Medium Priority) Was genetic testing or family counseling for familial hypertriglyceridemia considered to identify inherited lipid metabolism disorders that could inform targeted therapy?  \n*Rationale:* No explicit documentation of genetic work-up despite severe, refractory hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n7. (Medium Priority) Were multidisciplinary care teams (endocrinology, gastroenterology, nephrology, nutrition, pulmonology) involved consistently in the patient\u2019s management across admissions to coordinate complex care needs, particularly nutritional support and metabolic control?  \n*Rationale:* Early multidisciplinary involvement might have mitigated disease progression and complications.\n\n8. (Medium Priority) What antimicrobial stewardship strategies were employed to balance infection control with minimizing risks of resistant infections and fungal overgrowth, particularly during final admission with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals?  \n*Rationale:* Severe infections significantly contributed to morbidity and mortality.\n\n9.
